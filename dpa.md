## ACTUALLY RELIABLE DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM

This Data Processing Addendum, including its Schedules and Appendices ("**"DPA"**"), is incorporated into and forms part of the Actually Reliable Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, each as amended from time to time, or such other applicable written agreement between Actually Reliable LLC ("**"Actually Reliable"**") and the customer ("**"Customer"**") identified therein ("**"Agreement"**"), governing Customer's use of Actually Reliable's online services ("**"Services"**"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA carry the meanings given to them in the Agreement. Where any conflict arises between this DPA, any prior data processing addendum, and the Agreement, this DPA controls. Where any conflict or inconsistency exists between the body of this DPA and the UK Addendum and/or Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable), the UK Addendum and/or Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable) shall prevail.

Customer executes this DPA on its own behalf and, where required under applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations, on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates. For purposes of this DPA only, references to "Customer" include Customer and all Authorized Affiliates.

This DPA sets out the parties' agreement concerning the Processing of Personal Data. In performing the Services under the Agreement, Actually Reliable may Process Personal Data on Customer's behalf, and both parties commit to the obligations set out below.

2.2. **Customer's Processing of Personal Data.** Customer shall, in its use of the Services:

- 2.2.1. Process Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws and Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer's instructions for the Processing of Personal Data shall comply with Data Protection Laws and Regulations;
- 2.2.2. have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Personal Data and the means by which Customer acquires Personal Data;

Actually Reliable shall treat Personal Data as confidential information and shall only Process Personal Data: (1) to fulfill its obligations to Customer under the Agreement, including this DPA; (2) on behalf of Customer and in accordance with Customer's documented instructions; and (3) in compliance with Data Protection Laws and Regulations. This DPA and the Agreement are Customer's complete and final documented instructions to Actually Reliable for the Processing of Personal Data. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed upon separately. For the purposes of the UK Addendum and/or Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable), the following is deemed an instruction by the Customer to process Personal Data: (i) Processing in accordance with the Agreement; (ii) Processing initiated by Customer and/or its End Users in their use of the Services; and (iii) Processing to comply with other reasonable documented instructions provided by Customer (e.g., via email) where such instructions are consistent with the terms of the Agreement and this DPA.

2.3.2. The subject matter of Processing of Personal Data by Actually Reliable is the performance of the Services pursuant to the Agreement. The duration of the Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, and the types of Personal Data and categories of Data Subjects Processed under this DPA are further specified in Schedule 1.

2.3.3. Without prejudice to section 2.3.1, Actually Reliable shall:

- i. Not "sell" Personal Data or "share" Personal Data for purposes of "cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising" as such terms are defined under U.S. Privacy Laws;

Actually Reliable will cooperate with Customer reasonably in responding to any such request. Where disclosure of a government request to Customer is prohibited by applicable law, Actually Reliable will notify Customer that continued compliance with Customer's instructions is no longer possible — without specifying the reason — and will await further direction from Customer. Actually Reliable will exhaust all available legal mechanisms, including challenging any accompanying non-disclosure orders, when responding to national security demands for data access.

Actually Reliable shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Customer if Actually Reliable receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise the Data Subject's rights related to Personal Data under Data Protection Laws and Regulations, including the right of access, right to rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure ("right to be forgotten"), data portability; to object to the Processing, or to assert its right not to be subject to an automated individual decision making process ("**Data Subject Request**"). Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Actually Reliable shall assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of Customer's obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request under Data Protection Laws and Regulations. In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, Actually Reliable shall upon Customer's request provide commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent Actually Reliable is legally permitted to do so and the response is required under Data Protection Laws and Regulations. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising from Actually Reliable's provision of such assistance.

### 4. ACTUALLY RELIABLE PERSONNEL

4.3. **Limitation of Access.** Access to Personal Data is restricted to personnel whose roles require it for the purpose of delivering the Services under the Agreement.

### 5. SUBPROCESSORS

5.1. **Appointment of Subprocessors.** Customer acknowledges and agrees that Actually Reliable may engage third-party Subprocessors in connection with the provision of the Services. Actually Reliable has entered into a written agreement with each Subprocessor containing data protection obligations not less protective than those in this DPA with respect to the protection of Personal Data, to the extent applicable to the nature of the Services provided by such Subprocessor.

5.2. **List of Current Subprocessors and Notification of New Subprocessors.** Actually Reliable shall make available to Customer the current list of Subprocessors for the Actually Reliable Services on Actually Reliable's website at [actuallyreliable.com/legal/subprocessors](https://actuallyreliable.com/legal/subprocessors). Actually Reliable shall provide notification to the Customer of a new Subprocessor(s) before authorizing any new Subprocessor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.

5.3. **Objection Right for New Subprocessors.** Customer may object to Actually Reliable's use of a new Subprocessor by notifying Actually Reliable promptly in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of Actually Reliable's notice of a new Subprocessor in accordance with Section 5.2. In the event Customer objects to a new Subprocessor, Actually Reliable may, at its option, use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer's configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the new Subprocessor without unreasonably burdening the Customer. If Actually Reliable is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, Customer may terminate with written notice to Actually Reliable the applicable Agreement solely with respect to Services that cannot be provided by Actually Reliable without use of the new Subprocessor. As of the effective date of termination, Actually Reliable will refund Customer any prepaid fees such terminated Services covering the remainder of the term and will not penalize Customer for such termination.

### 6. SECURITY

6.1. **Controls for the Protection of Personal Data.** Actually Reliable maintains appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful Processing, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access. These measures are described in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Actually Reliable will not materially reduce the overall level of security applicable to the Services during any active subscription term.

6.2. **Third-Party Certifications and Audits.** Upon written request from Customer at reasonable intervals, and subject to the confidentiality obligations in the Agreement, Actually Reliable will provide Customer with its most recent available third-party audit reports or security certifications, or where such documentation does not exist, a written summary of its current security practices. This provision does not apply where Customer or Customer's designated auditor is a direct competitor of Actually Reliable.

6.3. **Unauthorized Processing of Personal Data.** Customer retains the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized Processing of Personal Data, including any Processing of Personal Data not authorized in this DPA.

---

### 7. PERSONAL DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION

Actually Reliable maintains security incident management policies and procedures as described in the Security, Privacy and Architecture Documentation. Upon becoming aware of any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, Personal Data Processed by Actually Reliable or its Subprocessors (a "**Personal Data Incident**"), Actually Reliable will notify Customer without undue delay and in any event within 72 hours, in compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations. Actually Reliable will take commercially reasonable steps to identify the root cause of the incident and remediate it to the extent within Actually Reliable's reasonable control. Notification obligations under this section do not apply to incidents caused by Customer or Customer's End Users.

---

---

### 9. AUTHORIZED AFFILIATES

9.1. **Contractual Relationship.** Each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this DPA and, to the extent applicable, the Agreement. Further, all access to and use of the Services by Authorized Affiliates must comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by an Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, an Authorized Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the Agreement by Customer entering into this DPA, and is only a party to the DPA.

9.2. **Communication.** Customer shall remain responsible for coordinating all communication with Actually Reliable under this DPA and be entitled to make and receive any communication in relation to this DPA on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates.

9.3. **Rights of Authorized Affiliates.** Where an Authorized Affiliate becomes a party to the DPA with Actually Reliable, it shall, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations, be entitled to exercise the rights and seek remedies under this DPA, subject to the following:

9.3.1. Except where applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations require that the Authorized Affiliate exercise a right or seek any remedy under this DPA against Actually Reliable directly by itself, the parties agree that (a) only Customer shall exercise any such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Authorized Affiliate, and that (b) Customer shall exercise any such rights under this DPA in a combined manner for all of its Authorized Affiliates together (as set forth, for example, in Section 9.3.2, below), not separately for each Authorized Affiliate individually.

9.3.2. The parties agree that Customer shall, when carrying out an on-site audit of the procedures relevant to protecting Personal Data, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on Actually Reliable and its Subprocessors by combining, to the extent reasonably possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of different Authorized Affiliates in one single audit.

---

### 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the extent permitted under applicable Data Protection Laws and Regulations, each party's and all of its Affiliates' liability arising out of or related to this DPA and all DPAs between Authorized Affiliates and Actually Reliable, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, is subject to the limitations of liability set forth in the Agreement, and such limitations apply to the aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together. For the avoidance of doubt, Actually Reliable's and its Affiliates' total liability for all claims from the Customer and all of its Authorized Affiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and each DPA shall not be understood to apply individually and severally to Customer and/or to any Authorized Affiliate that is a contractual party to any such DPA.

---

### 11. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

11.1. Subject to the additional terms in Schedule 1, Actually Reliable makes available the Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum, which shall apply to any transfers of Personal Data under this DPA from the European Economic Area and/or their member states and Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, respectively, to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of Data Protection Laws and Regulations of the foregoing territories, to the extent such transfers are made in connection with the Processing of Personal Data under the DPA and are subject to such Data Protection Laws and Regulations.

11.2. To the extent legally required, by signing the Agreement, Customer and Actually Reliable are deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, which form part of this DPA and (except as described in Section 11.4 and 11.5 below) will be deemed completed as follows:

11.2.1. Module 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses applies to transfers of Personal Data from Customer (as a Controller) to Actually Reliable (as a Processor) and Module 3 of the Standard Contractual Clauses applies to transfers of Personal Data from Customer (as a Processor) to Actually Reliable (as a Processor);

11.2.2. Clause 7 (the optional docking clause) is included;

11.2.3. Under Clause 9 (Use of sub-processors), the Parties select Option 2 (General written authorization);

11.2.4. Under Clause 11 (Redress), the optional language requiring that Data Subjects be permitted to lodge a complaint with an independent dispute resolution body shall not be deemed to be included;

11.2.5. Under Clause 17 (Governing law), the Parties choose Option 1 (the law of an EU Member State that allows for third-Party beneficiary rights). The Parties select the laws of Ireland;

11.2.6. Under Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction), the Parties select the courts of Ireland;

11.2.7. Annex I(A) and I(B) (List of Parties) is completed as set forth in Schedule 1;

11.2.8. Under Annex I(C) (Competent supervisory authority), the Parties shall follow the rules for identifying such authority under Clause 13 and, to the extent legally permissible, select the Irish Data Protection Commission;

11.2.9. Annex II (Technical and organizational measures) is completed with Schedule 1 of this DPA; and

11.2.10. Annex III (List of subprocessors) is not applicable as the Parties have chosen General Authorization under Clause 9.

11.3. With respect to Personal Data transferred from the United Kingdom for which United Kingdom law (and not the law in any European Economic Area jurisdiction or Switzerland) governs the international nature of the transfer, the UK Addendum forms part of this DPA and takes precedence over the rest of this DPA as set forth in the UK Addendum. Undefined capitalized terms used in this provision shall mean the definitions in the UK Addendum. For purposes of the UK Addendum, they shall be deemed completed as follows: (a) the Parties' details shall be the Parties and their affiliates to the extent any of them is involved in such transfer; (b) the Key Contacts shall be the contacts set forth in Schedule 1; (c) the Approved Standard Contractual Clauses referenced in Table 2 shall be the Standard Contractual Clauses as executed by the Parties; (d) either Party may end this DPA as set out in Section 19 of the UK Addendum; and (e) by entering into the Agreement, the Parties are deemed to be signing the UK Addendum.

11.4. For transfers of Personal Data that are subject to the FADP, the Standard Contractual Clauses form part of this DPA as set forth in Section 7 of this DPA, but with the following differences to the extent required by the FADP: (1) references to the GDPR in the Standard Contractual Clauses are to be understood as references to the FADP insofar as the data transfers are subject exclusively to the FADP and not to the GDPR; (2) references to personal data in the Standard Contractual Clauses also refer to data about identifiable legal entities until the entry into force of revisions to the FADP that eliminate this broader scope; (3) the term "member state" in Standard Contractual Clauses shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the Standard Contractual Clauses; and (4) the relevant supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (for transfers subject to the FADP and not the GDPR), or both such Commissioner and the supervisory authority identified in the Standard Contractual Clauses (where the FADP and GDPR apply, respectively).

11.5. Copies of Subprocessor Agreements. The parties agree that copies of the Subprocessor agreements that must be provided by Actually Reliable to Customer pursuant to the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses or Controller to Processor Clauses, or Processor to Processor Clauses may have all commercial information or clauses unrelated to the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses, Controller to Processor Clauses, or Processor to Processor Clauses removed by Actually Reliable beforehand; and, that such copies will be provided by Actually Reliable, in a manner to be determined in its discretion, only upon request by Customer.

11.6. Processor to Processor Clauses. For purposes of the Processor to Processor Clauses, Customer agrees that it is unlikely that Actually Reliable will know the identity of Customer's Controller(s) because Actually Reliable does not have a direct relationship with such Controller(s). Therefore, Customer will fulfill any and all of Actually Reliable's obligations to Customer's Controller(s) under the Processor to Processor Clauses.

11.7. Audits and Certifications. The parties agree that the audits described in the UK Addendum and/or Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable) shall be carried out in accordance with Section 6.2 of the DPA.

11.8. Certification of Deletion. The parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in the UK Addendum and/or Standard Contractual Clauses (as applicable) shall be provided by Actually Reliable to Customer only upon Customer's request.
